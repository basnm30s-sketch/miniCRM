# Requirements (reqmts)

This folder contains Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) for the project MVP: generating PDF quotes and the associated master screens and flows.

Files:
- `PRD_MVP.md` — High-level PRD for the MVP (goals, scope, success metrics, approach).
- `PRD_Screens.md` — List of master screens, wireframe notes and navigation.
- `PRD_Acceptance.md` — Acceptance criteria, edge cases and QA checklist.
- `PRD_DataModel.md` — Data model (quote schema, endpoints and storage notes).

Next steps:
1. Review the PRDs below and answer the clarifying questions in `PRD_MVP.md`.
2. I will iterate the PRDs and produce a task list and implementation plan (tickets, estimate-size).
